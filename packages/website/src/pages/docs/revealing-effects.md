# Revealing Effects

**React Awesome Reveal** exports a number of ready-to-use animated primitives to automagically :sparkles: animate your components.

By default, all animations are triggered when the content they wrap enters the viewport.

## Available Effects

- `<Bounce />`
- `<Fade />`
- `<Flip />`
- `<Hinge />`
- `<JackInTheBox />`
- `<Roll />`
- `<Rotate />`
- `<Slide />`
- `<Zoom />`
