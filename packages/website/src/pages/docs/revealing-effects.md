# Revealing Effects

<div class="admonition-warning">Section under construction <span role="img" aria-label="construction worker">ðŸ‘·</span></div>

**React Awesome Reveal** exports a number of ready-to-use animated primitives to automagically animate your components.

By default, all animations are triggered when the content they wrap enters the viewport. This feature is implemented using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API), which is a performant, modern and well supported standard API to detect when a certain element appears in the browser viewport.

## Available Effects

- `<Bounce />`
- `<Fade />`
- `<Flip />`
- `<Hinge />`
- `<JackInTheBox />`
- `<Roll />`
- `<Rotate />`
