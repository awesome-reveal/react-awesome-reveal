**React Awesome Reveal** is entirely written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), so if you use a code editor that supports it, you will get coding assistance and autocompletions for free.

You are of course not forced to write your code in TypeScript, as you will get autocompletions even in JavaScript codebases. However, adopting TypeScript is recommended to improve the code resilience and maintenability.
